  <p class="chapter">The Beginning</p>

  <p> How does a pandemic start? It takes one person.</p>
  <p> A pandemic occurs when a disease spreads over a country, and ultimately, the world. Near the end of 2019, Wuhan, China began treating the first patients infected with the Coronavirus. 19 days after the first reported death in China, the virus had spread to the United States. In the span of three months the virus led to social distancing, business and school closures, and fear. The Coronavirus has altered everyone's daily lives, causing indiviudals to be more consciously aware of their health and interactions with their communities. But what about the subconcious effects? How has the virus impacted the mental health of individuals through different age groups? Let's find out.<p>

  <p> From their first steps, to their first words, to their first pandemic. Learning how to walk and talk is just the start for these young kids.</p>

    <p>This pivotal age group requires structure for psychological and emotional development, according to Jena Lee, MD, medical director at David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>"The consistency of schedules, predictable rules and consequences, and set expectations teach children how to behave, develop self-discipline and impulse control and, importantly, a sense of safety and control," said Lee in an interview with Healio Psychiatry.</p>

  <p>Children learn behaviors from mirroring adults. According to Lee in an interview with Healio Psychiatry, When there is no set structure and parents visibly have a hard time managing their stress, children are more likely to develop behavioral problems.</p>

  <p>A study done by the China-EPA-UNEPSA showed that children ages three to six are "more likely than older children to manifest symptoms, such as clinginess and fear that family members could contract the infection." Facing this pandemic at such a young age has caused children to lack structure and learn behaviors based off of stress and fear.</p>

  <p>"I'm scared the coronavirus is going to hurt my grandma," said Ava Johnson, 9.</p>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has left children fearful that their family members will contract the disease while at work. As a result, this has led to heightened stress and anxiety surrounding every day life, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/17/us-children-mental-health-coronavirus">The Guardian</a>.</p>
  <p>Research has shown children are having a harder time expressing their emotions during these stressful times. “All of those environmental factors have led to an increase in anxiety among our young people, and I think this will only add more fuel to the fire,” said Nance Roy, chief clinical officer at the JED Foundation, in an interview with The Guardian.</p>
  <p>This age groups mental health has been greatly impacted by the the uncertainty of the future and the fear of the virus.</p>

    <p>Over the past years, research has shown increases in anxiety and depression rates among college aged individuals.</p>
    <p>Facing the circumstances of the virus and school closures, college students are having a harder time finding their sense of belonging, according to Sarah Lipson, PhD, assistant proessor at Boston University School of Public Health. Lack of a sense of belonging creates an anxious environment and leads to greater negative impacts on one's mental health.</p>
    <p>"In addition to depression and loneliness, college students will also likely face increased rates of anxiety, fueled by the uncertainties surrounding the virus," said Lipson in an interview with Healio Psychiatry.</p>
    <p>Individuals who have previously struggled with mental health disorders are especially at risk during these times.</p>

  <p>After learning about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's important to take action to help minimize these effects.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.parents.com/health/coronavirus/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-will-affect-childrens-long-term-mental-health/">Parents Magazine</a> suggests focusing on the positive and recognizing children's feelings in order to promote positive mental health. According to Healio Psychiatry, research shows making set plans will help children maintain stability during these unprecedented times.</p>
  <p>Lastly, it's important to promote social interaction. Parents Magazine says to utilize virtual platforms, such as FaceTime, to allow children to maintain connections to peers.</p>
  <p>“We have to spend more time with our children than we ever did before and we discover that maybe, maybe we don’t know them as well as we thought we did” said Oksana Hagerty, PhD, assistant director at Beacon College, in an interview with <a href="https://www.wdio.com/coronavirus/teenager-pandemic-covid-19-/5728500/">WDIO-DT.</a></p>
