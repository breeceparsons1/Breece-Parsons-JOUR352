    <p> From their first steps, to their first words, to their first pandemic. Learning how to walk and talk is just the start for these young kids.</p>

      <p>This pivotal age group requires structure for psychological and emotional development, according to Jena Lee, MD, medical director at David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

    <p>"The consistency of schedules, predictable rules and consequences, and set expectations teach children how to behave, develop self-discipline and impulse control and, importantly, a sense of safety and control," said Lee in an interview with Healio Psychiatry.</p>

    <p>Children learn behaviors from mirroring adults. According to Lee in an interview with Healio Psychiatry, When there is no set structure and parents visibly have a hard time managing their stress, children are more likely to develop behavioral problems.</p>

    <p>A study done by the China-EPA-UNEPSA showed that children ages three to six are "more likely than older children to manifest symptoms, such as clinginess and fear that family members could contract the infection." Facing this pandemic at such a young age has caused children to lack structure and learn behaviors based off of stress and fear.</p>
